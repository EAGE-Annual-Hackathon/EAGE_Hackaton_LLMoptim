It was drilled as horizontal oil producer in the Tor formation in the north-western part of the field. The well was planned to have 5/8 liner drilled into the Tor reservoir and '/2-' heavy wall liner casing the reservoir. The well was drilled to total depth of 5434 MD/2627 TVD with 1425 horizontal section. 10 tracks were required to reach the well TD and to case the reservoir section. Five of those tracks were in the overburden and five were in the reservoir. The sidetracks in the overburden were mainly due the problems experienced to cross a fault just above the entry into the reservoir. The sidetracks in the reservoir were due to the very thin reservoir experienced and to the much higher than predicted reservoir pressure experienced at the end of the track 8. Two of the tracks drilled in the reservoir were short accidental sidetracks. The length of the abandoned tracks makes total of 2880 in, which brings the drilled length to 8300 m. The well vs as planned to reach TD with liner strings. However five liner strings were run, two of which did not reach the section TD and were pulled. An extra casing string was required to reach the reservoir, 7 liner and the reservoir itself was cased with 4-1/2 liner, which was run to 5378 m. The objectives of the well when it comes to data gathering and well design were in general met, however the total well cost was much higher than budgeted. Total time for the well, skid to skid, was 192 days, with total cost of 392 MNOK (43 mill USD at NOK/USD). The AFE for the well was 72 days and MNOK. 16 Section After skidding the rig and running and testing the 21 1/4 BOP and riser the 16 section was started with drilling the conductor shoe track and of new formation. An FIT was carried out demonstrating rock strength of ppg. The section was drilled with 12,6 ppg carbosea mud and the flow rates used were 1100 gpm. Hole stability over the section was good. Between 120m and 1300m small amount of mainly blocky cavings were observed. There was no increase in background gas, or evidence of connection gas, which suggested that these cavings were not due to over pressure. The gas levels observed were lower than in most of' the Valhall WP wells. Maximum reported gas while drilling was 14.1%. The section was drilled to TD at 1742m. Serious problems were experienced coming out of the hole alter reaching the ID. Iole cleaning was identified as major challenge during the planning stage, mainly due to extensive directional work and high inclination. number of measures were implemented to secure good hole cleaning such as: controlled ROP. maximum flow rates. extensive circulation and reaming on connections, monitoring the off-bottom torque and drag. I low,eNer despite the precautions, hole cleaning was not optimal. wiper trip with rotary assembly was performed and this finally cleaned the hole and made it tit to run casing. Almost days were used to come out of the hole with the drilling assembly and to perform the wiper trip. For the future is\",\n",
       " \"LA6,0tft r- VALI IALL WP 2/8 F-15 110 Page: of Section FINAL WELL REPORT, DRILLING Date: 02104/2002 Rev: recommended to run MWD with pressure sub in order to have better control on hole cleaning and also on backreaming out of hole in case this is required after reaching the section TD. The 13 3/8 casing was run and cemented at 1742m Overburden Section A conventional rotary assembly was used to drill out the 13 3/8 shoe and 45 of formation. An FIT was carried out below the shoe confirming rock strength of at least ppg equivalent mud weight. This run was followed by an 1/4AutoTrak and 13 'A' Near Bit Reamer assembly which drilled 12 ' and 13 hole to 3000m. At this depth wiper trip was performed to the 13 3/8 shoe. When staging up the pumps at TD, mud losses were encountered at surface and possibly down hole. Drilling continued to 3616m, where the AutoTrak tool failed. The failed AutoTrak assembly was pumped out of the hole. new AutoTrak tool was made up and staged in hole. Circulation was lost at 3558 while staging up the flow rates to drilling rates. This was probably due to pack off further up the hole and/or weak zone in the upper part of the hole. After losses and regain of circulation the BHA was pumped out of the hole. During pumping out of hole the formation was giving back the lost mud. flow check performed at 1945 m. showed gain with an increased trend and based on that it was decided to shut the well in. Attempted unsuccessfully to circulate out the influx due to extreme cavings blockage in the chokes and in the choke lines. Consequently the annular was opened in intervals to bleed off trapped wellbore pressures. The well continued to flow at decreasing rate and it was decided to pump the string out of the hole. The well was stabilised while pumping out confirming that well influx was charged mud to formation. Staged in hole with new bottom hole assembly. It was not possible to reach the required flow rate for drilling without incurring losses. It was decided that an intermediate casing string was required. The string was pumped out of the hole to run 5/8 liner. After lay ing down the AutoTrak assembly the 9-5/fr liner run in. The hanger and the TSP packer were set.

It is great uncertainty not knowing whether the running tool is free after setting the liner and before cementing. The landing collar was only rated @ 3000 psi.

The rupture disc did not rupture @ 2500 psi and only repeated attempts with Halliburton pump, did we manage to establish circulation (at this time, there was cement in the string from the cementing unit and to the landing collar).

AFE Actual Approved AFE Cost Revised AFE Cost Actual Cost The 20 conductor was set during the batch setting operation in September 1997. The actual cost for the 20 batch setting also included the shallow gas assessment and the drilling of pilot hole (distributed equally all nine batch set wells in September 1997). 3.1.1 Cost Estimating System A four step Cost Process that was used on the WP World Class wells. It is the vendors themselves that are responsible for all the equipment, personnel and also for giving the budget and follow up the cost of the well. Step is to estimate the cost for the onshore planning including participation of offshore personnel in planning and pre-spud meetings etc. Based on the estimated cost the contractors will receive purchase order that is used in planning phase. Step is to collect data from the vendors on their estimated cost for the execution phase, which includes all equipment and personnel. This data stays at the base of the target cost estimation, which mainly depends on the target days. Target cost is the lowest cost for drilling the well if everything goes as planned. No contingency is used when calculating estimating the target cost. separate AFE cost with contingency is also prepared. Step is the weekly cost reports that all the vendors have to send in and this is at the base of the weekly management cost reports. This should include all costs for the week (onshore and offshore), both personnel, equipment, onshore planning, mobilization cost, etc. This report is used for tracking the actual cost against the target cost. The 4111 and final step is the final cost reporting which takes place within two weeks after the well is finished. The final cost report includes summary of the contractors' budget and the actual cost. This is matched with the issued and outstanding invoices. The cost !earnings from this well hax already been implemented in the next well. The) are: 1) To give more details in the Planning and Target cost budget. If we have breakdown of what the cost are it is also easier to compare when it comes to overrun. 2) Weekly cost reporting needs to be improved by giving more explanations during the well why we do have the overruns.\",\n",

As compensatory measure, the well F-10T2 had wireline plug installed at 600m. total of 14 wells were monitored while drilling this section. To avoid shutting in the wells an application to deviate was prepared and approved. number of compensatory actions were implemented to bring the risk within acceptable level. The TD of the section was 1742 mMD (1332 mTVD). The section was drilled with carbosea OBM. The section was started with 12,0 ppg mud. The mud weight was gradually increased to ppg down to 800 mMD and to ppg by 1000 mMD. The hole was drilled to TD with ppg mud and displaced to ppg mud prior to pulling out of hole to run casing. Gas values ranged from 0.2% to 14.1% (at 1437mMD). Average gas values rose from 0.5% to 2.3% at around 1000m MD and continued to rise, reaching 8.3% at 1400m MD persisting to TD of the section. The higher gas readings recorded over this section, were associated with the increase in pore pressure together with higher drilling rates towards the end of the section when drilling in rotary mode. Swab and ream/connection gases were frequently observed after 950m MD, in the pressure build up zone, indicating that the section was drilled close to balance in the lower parts of the section. This gas had high heavy content indicating charging from the reservoir. The gas levels registered in the 16 section on this well were low comparing to other Valhall wells. Max gas reported during the wiper trip was 25% while reaming hard stringer at 1238m.\",\n",
       " 'Obp VALI1ALL WP 2/8 F-15 Page: of 24 Section FINAL WELL REPORT. DRILLING Date: Feb-02 Rev: Hole stability over the section was good. For short period between 1120m and 1300m the amount of cavings increased from trace to up to 30%. These were mainly blocky, but with some leaf like cavings which resembled pressure cavings. There was no increase in background gas, or evidence of connection gas. which suggested that these cavings were not due to over pressure. Analysis of parameters from drilling and circulating suggests that hole cleaning was insufficient. Looking at the mud loss plot this indicates good hole cleaning and hole condition. The cavings log shows considerable amount of cavings. If there was good hole cleaning the mud loss plot should have shown more loss than it actually did. The torque drag plot did not show any signs of hole loading cuttings. Carbide was dropped at TD and indicated an average open hole diameter of 18.5-. Comparing this with the mud loss plot indicates hole that was not sufficient cleaned of cuttings and cavings. A considerable amount of time during drilling of the section was used to circulate and clean the hole. Limitation on the rpm speed, 13Orpm during drilling and 11Orpm during reaming did not look to be adequate for optimal hole cleaning. POOH with the drilling assembly also showed insufficient hole cleaning, due to several tight spots. The wiper trip managed to clean up the hole when circulating at 1310m and at TD large amounts of cuttings and fines were seen, cleaning the hole for fairly slick trip out. Hole cleaning was managed by circulating the cuttings into the casing shoe before connections. After every third stand drilled, bottom up was circulated. The hole was drilled with low flow rate in the soft upper section of 800 gpm down to 562 m. Once it was confirmed that directional work is progressing according to plan and passed wells F-10T2 & F-13T2, the flow rate was increased to 1100 gpm. Hole cleaning in this section was suboptimal and serious problems were experienced while tripping out of hole after section TD. The section was drilled to TD at 1742m. 34 hrs were used to come out of the hole with the drilling assembly and 37 hrs to perform the wiper trip. 4.2.2 13 3/8 Casing running and cementing operations. 143 joints of 13 3/8 P110, 72ppf casing, with New Vam connections including shoe float and two pup joints, were run. The shoe was set at 1738m MD (1330m TVD). No losses were experienced while running casing. Circulation was established and the hole displaced to 12.6ppg mud. Started circulation with 420 gpm at 1830 psi but had to reduce in steps to 290 gpm in order to stem losses. Lost an estimated 112bbls of mud to the formation. The cementing operation started by pumping 90bbls of 12.8ppg spacer with the rig pumps. Released bottom plug and pumped another 3bbls of spacer. Pumped 346bbls of 13.0ppg lead cement at 270gpm and 239bbls of 16.0ppg tail cement at 210gpm. Released the top plug and displaced cement with Obbls of 12.8ppg spacer and 822bbls of ppg mud at 300-350gpm using the rig pumps. The plug was bumped after 8220stk with 2200psi, giving 95.7% pump efficiency. The pressure was held on to check the casing and after bleeding the pressure flow check was performed to verify the floats. A total of 218bbls (spacer and cement) was lost to the formation during displacement. Contaminated spacer was observed in returns after 6600 strokes.',\n",

The objective of the 12 1/4 13 1/2 overburden hole section was to deliver stable and clean wellbore drilled just above the Tor formation, to allow 5/8 liner to be drilled and set successfully into the reservoir. A conventional rotary assembly with 12 1/4 rock bit (MM44NG, bit#3) was used to drill the 13 3/8 shoe-track and 45 of new formation. While drilling the shoe track, the well was displaced to ppg mud. An FIT was carried out 3m below the shoe, demonstrating minimum rock strength of ppg equivalent mud weight. The cleanout run was followed by drilling assembly run with 12 1/4 PDC bit (FM2943DR, bit#4), 1/4AutoTrak and 13 1/2 Near Bit Reamer on 1/2 DP. This assembly drilled 12 1/4 and 13 1/2 hole to 3000m. The flow rate was held between 800 and 950 gpm, with ECD around 14,6-14.8 ppg EMW. Mud weight was increased from to over the section. The BHA with the rotary steerable tool followed the planned well path. A wiper trip was performed to the 13 3/8 shoe and back to bottom. When staging up the pumps at TD, mud losses were encountered at surface and possibly down hole. Drilling continued to 3616m, where the AutoTrak tool failed. The failed AutoTrak assembly was pumped out of the hole. A new AutoTrak tool was made up and run in the hole. Circulation was lost at 3558m while staging in the hole. This was probably due to pack off higher up the hole and/or weak zone in the upper part of the open hole. Lost approximately 150 bbl mud Circulation was regained and the BHA pumped out of the hole. During pumping out of hole the formation was giving back the lost mud. This was experienced before at Valhall. flow check was performed at 1945 m. Place the well on the trip tank and observed bbl gain with an increase flow trend. Decided to shut the well in. Due to extreme blockages in the chokes and the choke lines with large cuttings did not manage to circulate out the influx. Consequently the annular was opened in intervals to bleed off trapped wellbore pressures. The well continued to flow at decreasing rate levelling at bbl/hr. The decision was taken to pump out of the hole. The well was stabilised while pumping out confirming that the well influx was mud previously charged into formation. The near bit reamer (NBR) was seen to cause high ECD and swabbing. As consequence the NBR was left out in the new BHA. No fill on bottom was observed and the hole was in good condition. It was not possible to reach the required flow rate for drilling without incurring losses, which at one point were up to 18 bbl/hr. The hole was circulated clean and swept with 35 bbl LCM pill. flow check was undertaken which showed positive bbl/hr influx rate. The mud weight was increased from ppg to ppg. Losses where encountered at 3588m after staging up the pumps to drilling rate. This can be attributed to weak zone probably at around 2200m. It was decided that an intermediate casing string was required. The BHA was pumped out of the hole to run 5/8 Liner. 70 bbls were lost on the trip out. Minor ca ings were seen on this section as follows. At 1745m w/bit#3 5-10% cavings were seen 4- 6cm 1.5cm generated. While drilling the section w/bit#4 1% cavings were seen or less.',\n",
       " 'bp -ThSection VALI IALL WP 2/8 F-15 TIO Page: of 24 4 FINAL WELL REPORT, DRILLING Date: Feb-02 Rev: At 3000m on wiper trip few large cavings seen at the shakers, also at 1896m 10-15% cavings were seen when pulling out (from shoe area). On trip w/bit#5 moderate amount of large cavings were seen at 1955m. The hole condition while drilling the section was good with good cuttings bed seen at the shakers and trace cavings seen. Flow was always between 930-950gpm, which appeared to clean the hole fairly adequately down to 3000m. The mud loss plot showed more cuttings were generated indicating a larger than hole size - (gas peaks were late on the wiper trips at TD). The MWD ECD was good indicator of hole cleaning and readings down to 3000m were never higher than 14.88ppg once the weight was up to 14.6ppg (1930m) and generally ranging from 14.71ppg to 14.77ppg. From 2000m limestone stringers caused 10-20klbs overpull at connections and often needed to be wiped to reduce the drag before making connection. From 3000m the hole showed it needed more cleaning as before the wiper trip the shakers were still heavy after BU. When circulating on the way back in at 2962m many fines blinded the shakers. The ECD reached 14.94ppg, but dropped to 14.75ppg as the hole cleaned up. The wiper trip showed little drag or o/pull. Again the hole required circulating at 3455m ECD reduced to 14.69ppg and PU weight by 30klbs plus torque by kftlb. At 3616m 2x BU was needed for the hole to clean up with ECD reducing to 14.71ppg. On POH max o/pull was 10-25klbs. At 1897m while pulling out circulating ECD reached 14.87ppg then reducing to 14.73ppg after offloading some cavings. The generation of cavings at 1897m and then on run#5 as the hole started gaining, indicated the loss- gain nature of the well was starting to cause some instability. Further cavings seen on run#6 and more cuttings down to 3144m, indicated need for more cleaning. But on reaching TD on run #6 no fill was seen and BU produced few cuttings. Tripping out for casing produced few tight spots. t Background gas values increased from 3% at the shoe to 20% at 2050m dropping to average 4% at 2200m then ranging from 2-14% but averaging 3-4% to the end of section. Connection gases were seen from 3540m to 3616m (max 6.4%). 4.3.2 9-5/8 Liner running and cementing operations The AutoTrak assembly was laid down and the 9-5/8 liner rigged up and run in.

Ran liner. 4.4.6 Drilling fluid density Borehole stability was one of the major problems in this section. As we increased the mud weight it appears the hole became more stable. The fracture gradient in this section of the hole was underestimated. The track T5 was drilled with 15 ppg mud and the ECUs registered were as high as 15.8 ppg. T1: Drilled cement and new formation with 14,6 ppg to 4021 inIVID where hole packed off. Raised mud gradient to 14,7 ppg to aid in Vs ellbore stability. T2: 14,7 ppg throughout the section. T3: Remained constant at 14,7 ppg throughout the section. Again, the actual h)drostatic pressure in well will be less due to temperature effects on density. Prior re-entering T3, density was raised to 14,8 ppg and then further up to ppg. No submit face losses encountered, eN en though ECD gradient reached high levels of 15,50 ppg. T4: Remained constant at 15,0 ppg throughout the section. Formation intact without fracturing, even though ECD reached high levels as high as 15,50 ppg T5: Remained constant at 15,0 ppg throughout the section. No subsurface losses during drilling stage, even though ECD reached levels of 15,8 ppg. 4.4.7 Hole condition/ cleaning A major issue vas the low annular velocity in the 13 3/8 casing causing cuttings to drop out and sit on the top of the 5/8 liner. This area had to be regularly cleaned on trips and caused plugging when running in with diverters for cement jobs and problems with the 5/8 drilling liner. When running in the mud was circulated regularly to allow it to heat up and become less viscous. Running speeds were moderated and pumps were carefully staged up to prevent surging. The hole was cleaned well and according to mud loss plots the correct theoretical cuttings volumes were produced at the shakers - good cuttings beds were observed at the shakers when receiving drilled returns. At 3777m cuttings were produced on run #8 after supposedly clean hole at 4021m. Also extra cuttings were seen in returns as the weight was increased to 15.0ppg at the start of -U4, suggesting that cleaning was good but still not 100%. Hole condition was unstable below 3900m causing packing off and in the case of T4 collapse. Losses in the first hole track were seen on pack offs and on the under-reamer run seepage occurred at ECDs of 15.0ppg. Few losses were seen when drilling on the sidetrack sections with constant ECD values at 15.4ppg on T4 and T5. maximum ECD (calculated) of 15.54ppg was seen before losses were induced on the liner run. With cuttings in the hole good circulation would often gi%c drop of 0.1ppg after clean up. 4.4.8 Gas Levels Original hole showed average gas values ranging from 0.8-1%.

Circulation was broken after installation of the hanger and every 10 stands, the top of the 5/8 liner was washed through carefully and extra stands. At 2018m, staged pumps then the liner was washed down gently for stands as the hanger entered the liner top, no weight taken.

DRILLING Date: Feb-02 Rev: 4.5 Hole Section and 4-1/2 liner running and cementing 4.5.1 Hole Section Drilling sidetrack T5, from 3953m to 4161m (2535m - 2569m TVD) The objective was to drill/geo-steer horizontal hole within the Tor Formation, in the northwestern flank of Valhall. The total depth of the well was to be determined by L.O.T at the start of the reservoir section and obsery ed pore pressure increase. The hole was then to be opened to 8. prior to setting 1/2 liner. However this section unfortunately proved very problematic with faults, hole stability problems, higher pore pressure than predicted, losses and variable Tor thickness. The hole paths in this section were sidetracks T5, 1'6, T7, T8, T9, T10. 1/2 liner was eventually run on T1 after drilling into Lista. The hole was not opened. Bit# 15 was used for the cement squeeze job for the 7liner (see last section) it was then R1H to 3775m and washed down to 3835m; where cement was tagged. Patchy cement was reamed out to 3906m and firm cement down to 3936m. fhe casing was successfully pressure tested to 1750psi and the cement drilled out to the landing collar. The shoetrack and 20cm of new formation were drilled and after confirming formation in the returns an F.I.T to 16.1ppg EMW was performed. The well was progressively displaced to 12ppg mud and the bit POOH without incident. Next run was with directional drilling assembly (Bit FM2921, #1o). Staged in hole and circulate to condition mud at 2635m. 3048m and 3560m. At 3898m the pumps were staged up and the hole re- logged with MWD over the interval 3910m to 3953m. Drilling / Orienting continued from 3953m to 4066m, where an increase in both the pick-up weight and standpipe pressure was observed. l'he and 5/8 annular volumes were circulated clean prior to drilling ahead. Drilling / Orienting continued to 4076m. where problems were encountered getting back to bottom after orienting the tool-face. The bit was successhilly reamed to bottom and drilling / orienting continued to 4141m. Again the bit had to be reamed to bottom before drilling / orienting could resume. At 4150m the hole was backreamed very slowly and bottoms up circulated. Drilling / Orienting continued to 4161m. Whilst attempting to take survey, tight hole was encountered and the pipe had to be worked down with rotation. An overpull of 100klbs and pressure increase of 200 psi were observed. Whilst working the pipe down pressure drop and 40klbs loss in string weight occurred, indicating that Twist-off had occurred. total of 32 bbls of mud were lost to the formation as result of the hole packing off flow-check proved negative and the pipe was POOH. At surface the pipe was seen to have parted at service connection within the 3/4 jars, leaving 2079m of fish in the hole. An 1/2 Overshot fishing assembly was R1H. The pipe was washed down from 2031m to the top of the fish. The fish was engaged and latched onto -confirmed by an increase in the standpipe pressure and an overpull of 65klbs. The pipe was pumped out to 3574m with intermittent pack off tendencies and mud losses of 11 bbls. The hole was circulated to condition the mud with maximum gas of 14.5% recorded. The pipe was POOH without incident and the fish successfully recovered. A modified drilling assembly was RIM and the hole circulated for 20 minutes every 20 stands to condition the mud. At 3547m the hole volume was circulated with maximum gas of 8.5% recorded. The bit was RIH to 3902m. where it stood up with 10klbs. The bit was washed down to 3990m with\",\n",

At 3990m the string packed oil and the pipe was jarred free prior to staging up the pumps to 72gpm and washing down to 4000m. The hole was baekreamed over the inter\\\\ al 3995m to 3972m to obtain an MWD re-log for depth correlation. After reaming down to 3999m and circulating bottoms up the bit was RIH to 4014m, where it hung up with 20klbs. Again the hole was prone to packing off and mud losses. The bit was worked down to 4040m. where downhole losses of 60-70bbls/hr Nk ere recorded. Eventually the bit was worked down to 4056m, where 105bbls of LCM (20 ppb consisting Oppb OM seal and 10 ppb CaCO3) were pumped to inhibit the mud losses. Whilst circulating the LCM pill around the hole the bit was worked and baekreamed ON er the interval 4059m to 4112m, with intermittent tight hole, mud losses and pack offs. The LCM was observed at surface 1000 strokes earlier than expected. second ECM pill (30bbls) was pumped and chased with 12.2ppg mud to aid hole stability. The LCM arrked at the surface 1760 strokes earlier than calculated, whereas the increase in mud weight to 12.2ppg was observed late at the surface. The consensus of opinion was that cuttings and possibly barite was settling on the low side of the hole and casing. Once 12.2ppg had been established throughout the mud system the bit was worked down to 4119m, where the hole packed off again and the pipe had to be jarred free. The hole was backreamed to 4104m at 290gpm with losses of 35bbls/hr and another LCM pill pumped (54 bbls). Whilst displacing the LCM pill the bit was pumped out of the hole with tight spots encountered at 4096m, 4060m, 4056m, and 3972m to 3965m. At the liner shoe (3953m) flow check yielded gain of 0.5bblsihr. The bit was pumped out to 3557m and bottoms up circulated. The LCM arrived at surface 1270 strokes early and maximum gas of 8.6% recorded. flow check yielded gain of 0.9bbls,hr. The hole was displaced to 12.4ppg and circulated at full drilling rate (290gpm) without mud loss. further flow check proved negative and the bit was POOH to pick up clean out assembly. total of 298bbls of mud were lost to formation during this bit run. It was decided to perform cleanout run (Bit# 18 no NIVWD / Motor). At 1660m, whilst circulating bottoms up at 600gpin, moderate amounts of fines were observed at the shakers. The bit was RIH to 2696m, where the pumps were staged up to 540gpm and the hole circulated the equivalent of the r 5/8 volume abow, prior to R1I to 3546m. Whilst staging up the pumps losses occurred at 320gpm at rate of 25-30bbls/hr. maximum ECD of 12.7ppg and gas of 15.5% were recorded. The flow was reduced to 140gpm. however losses were still observed. flow check proved static and the bit was POOH to 2698m. The pumps were staged up to 580gpm (ECD 12.61ppg) without incident, however losses (12-15bbls/hr) occurred whilst bringing up the RPM to 45. The flow was cut back in stages with continual losses and flow check performed that yielded static losses of 7-8bbls/hr. At this stage total of 93bbls of mud had been lost to the formation. The bit was RII without loss to 3557m. The pumps were staged up to 60gpm, where losses of 30bbls/hr were evident.

The decision was made to set kick off plug and perform sidetrack (T6) from the shoe at 3953m. A 1/2 diverter tool was RIH on drillpipe to 3550m, where losses of Obbls/hr occurred whilst circulating at 215gpm. The flow was cut back to 180gpm until losses ceased and then gradually raised to 250gpm without loss Bottoms up were circulated with maximum gas of 10.4% recorded (20bbls of mud lost).

Drilled into Tor formation at 5162m. Motor stalled with subsequent increase in pump pressure going through the hard transition layer between Hod and Tor. Average background gas increased from approx. 2.6% in Hod to approx. 4.4% in Tor. Continued drilling and oriented hole. sudden pressure drop of 150psi at 5295m during drilling which gradually increased back to normal was noticed. secondary pressure drop of 200psi was recorded when picking off bottom after stand down. Pressure remained low. Continued to drill and orient and pump pressure returned to normal. Re-entered Hod formation at 5310m. BIIA was dropping slightly in rotary mode and had difficulty trying to nudge inclination up as string was hanging up. Circulated to reduce ECD but it remained at 13.26ppg EMW. Drilling to 5363m, circulated and reduced ECD from to 13.16ppg EMW. Nudged inclination up and drilled into Tor formation at 5465m (dip in Tor found to be r- deg). The hole was circulated to reduce torque and drag after sliding. Sliding and orientating proceeded to 5560m. Circulated BU (ECD reduced from 13.30ppg to ppg max gas peak of 14.2%).

       " 'CLIENT : DEN NORKE STATS OLJESELSKAP A.S. WELL : 35/10-1 VSP PROCESSING COMMENT DATA ACQUISITION A VSP check shot survey was carried out in the above well on 28th. December 1991. total of 276 check levels were recorded between and 875 below KB, spaced at mostly 15 and 7.5m depth intervals for use in the VSP processing. The data was recorded using GCH320 Dual geophone with the geophone elements spaced at 15 m, while the energy source used was an 160 cu.in. airgun operating at constant pressure of 1800 psi. The source was suspended 5m below MSL and offset from the wellhead. Due to the noise present in the levels above 2200m below KB the automated trace alignment procedure failed to give accurate times therefore times have been derived from filtered tape data where neccessary. DATA EDITING/PREPARATION The levels used in the VSP are shown in the depth/stack list along with the number of shots stacked together for each level. The check levels at and above 950m below KB have not been included in the VSP as they are at too large spacing from the other data. DATA PROCESSING A detailed description of the standard VSP processes and the resulting displays is contained in the Appendices at the end of this report. The VSP displays were processed as indicated on the side labels accompanying each display. STACKED GEOPHONE DATA A source signature deconvolution (380ms derivation window) has been applied to the data to remove the source bubble and to account for any slight variation in source output which would be detrimental to subsequent processing. Displays VA1-4(FK) shows the stacked geophone data in frequency-wavenumber space (split into parts due to the differently spaced sections). The preliminary filter has been derived from an examination of the data in F-K space to determine the useful bandwidth of the full data set. DOWNGOING WAVEFIELD Tests were performed on the downwave enhancement and subtraction. A dip filter with sample median operator, Oms/trace dip was considered to provide the optimum downwave estimate and has been used in the final processing. The first 1000ms of the downgoing wavefield has been used in the design of the Special VSP deconvolution operator. The deconvolved downgoing wavefields (Displays VH and VH (M)) show the effectiveness of the deconvolution operators in collapsing the downgoing wavefield into the first arrivals (within the design window) with both the zero phase and minimum phase filters applied.',\n",
       " 'UPGOING WAVEFIELD The optimum filter for the data set (2,5-70,80 Hz) has been derived after an examination of the upgoing data around TD in F-K space and after filter trials. Displays VC(FK) and VE(FK) respectively show the undeconvolved and deconvolved upgoing wavefield in F-K space. In order to enhance events within the data, dip filter (9 sample median operator, ms/trace dip) has been applied to both the deconvolved and undeconvolved data. At the request of the client minimum phase version of the final displays has been produced. Display VI shows the residual wavefield from which both the downgoing and upgoing wavefields have been removed. This is designed to show any diffraction hyperbolae within the data. INTERPRETERS COMPOSITES At the request of the client minimum phase version of the time variant filter from seismic line NOD4-84-06 has been applied to the deconvolved upgoing wavefield and the synthetic seismogram data set, to produce Display VG2 (M) Approved by D.

       " \"VERTICAL SEISMIC PROFILE REPORT APPENDIX Descriotion of V.S.P. Displays Vertical Well: Source at Well Head Display VA (Stacked Geophone Data at one-way time) This display indicates the quality of the data used in the subsequent VSP processing. The trace displayed for each geophone position is the result of editing, as appropriate, and summing common depth traces; the common depth traces haying undergone trace alignment procedure (based on cross correlation) in order to obtain accurate alignment prior to summation. Source signature deconvolution will have been applied to marine data, unless otherwise stated, usin2 the gun hydrophone signal as source signature. Wavelet stabilisation may optionally have been applied to the data to remove variations in source character due to changing source conditions, (particularly onshore) and/or variation in geophone coupling. A broad band filter will have been applied to this data in order to remove noise without compromising the usable bandwidth of the data. The polarity of this display is such that the first downgoing arrival is plotted as black peak. (SEC normal polarity) Display VA(FK) (F-K Display of Stacked Geophone Data at One-Way Time) This display shows the stacked geophone data (after source signature deconvolution, if appropriate) at one-way time transformed into F-K space. This data is displayed as wave number (K) against frequency, with variation in colour indicating amplitude in dB below the maximum amplitude. A velocity alignment in T-X space transforms to an alignment in F-K space, rotated through 90°; the various wavefields (i.e. velocity alignments) commonly observed in T-X space transform into F-K space as illustrated in Fig.1 The strongest wavefield will normally be the Downgoing wavefield and this transforms into an alignment from zero wave number, zero frequency sloping in the positive wave number lirection. Significant velocity changes in wavefield will result in multiple alignments in F-K space; although in practice it may not Oe possible to differentiate between the different F-K alignments and the resulting event may be smeared. /Cont'd....\",\n",
       " \"The data may be split into sections before transformation, in order to allow better analysis. The likely reasons for treating the data in this way are: to separate out areas of differing velocity, differing data quality, differing geophone separation or differing bandwidth. When alignments intercept the ! or -1 axis they will 'wrap around'. The frequency at which the intercept occurs is the fundamental alias frequency; further aliasing will occur at harmonics of this frequency. It should be noted that the resolution of the VSP data, after wavefield separation, is not limited by the fundamental alias frequency. The effects of spatial aliasing on the data will be small and, in particular, after application of non-linear spatial filters (i.e. our normal method of enhancing the data) the aliasing effects can be assumed to be negligible. This display illustrates, in convenient form, the various prominent wavefields in the data together with the extent of their frequency bandwidths, the general. noise level and specific noise problems. In addition to general data analysis, it is used to establish the usable bandwidth of the Downgoing Wavefield in order to design the broad band preliminary filter applied to the data in Display VA. Display VB (Downgoing Wavefield) This display represents series of downgoing wavefields observed at successive locations (i.e. geophone positions) in the borehole. This display is produced by shifting the data as shown in Display VA so that the direct arrivals, and therefore the Downgoing Wavefield are aligned in time; spatial filter is then applied to remove random noise and crossing wavefields. The downgoing wavefield trace extracted for each geophone position describes fully the multiple systems that will occur as tail to reflector at or near that geophone position. comparison of downgoing wavefield with reflection occurring at the same depth on the seismic section at the well, will reveal any residual multiple activity on the seismic section associated with that particular reflector. For this exercise the observed polarity of the reflection on the seismic section should be matched with the same polarity first arrival on the VSP downgoing wavefield, i.e. white trough matched to white trough or black peak to black peak. In the same manner the downgoing wavefield display can be correlated with the upgoing wavefield of Displays VC and VD to establish the presence and origin of multiples within the VSP data. Note that this display is provided in two forms: (a) VB1 : filtered with the broad band preliminary filter only. This display essentially shows the data from which the deconvolution operators have been derived. (b) VB2 : filtered so that the bandwidth matches that of the seismic data, in the zone of interest, to enable identification of residual multiples in the seismic data. This version is presented at the scale(s) of the seismic section. These displays are produced at both polarities. /Cont'd...\",\n",
       " \"Displays VC and VD (Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time; before and after enhancement) These displays show the Primary and Multiple activity observed at the borehole location frcm the shallowest VSP geophone position to some way below the deepest VSP geophone position (and therefore, normally, some way below Total Depth of the borehole). The data shown on Display VD is that of Display VC after application of spatial filter; this spatial filter will be the result of various trials and will have been chosen to give the best enhancement of the upgoing events (horizontal and/or dipping) observed in the data. In marine data, if source signature deconvolution has been applied, then the input wavelet will be zero-phase and the wavelet contained in the data will be zero phase modified by earth absorption and transmission loss effects (i.e. mixed phase). In the case of onshore data, if neither wavelet stablisation nor source signature deconvoluticn has been applied, then the source signature remains in the data. Wavelet stabilisation can be carried out by shaping to any given wavelet; we would recommend, however, that all geophone data is transformed to the waveform of shallow geophone level. In this case then the source signature effectively remains in the data but is made consistent from level to level. Events that reach the time-depth curve are primary and their lithologic significance can be established unequivocally by reference to the calibrated velocity log. This comparison can be made using Display VG1 which contains the data from Display VF and the calibrated velocity log at the scale(s) of the seismic section. Multiples having their last bounce from primary within the range of the VSP may be identified by observing their termination in the data at the same depth point at which the primary cuts the time-depth curve. From this display, any dip across the well location can be recognised by move- out of the primary event to shorter time, as the geophone moves up the well and away from the lithology creating the reflection. No azimuth of dip can be computed from this display but true-dip can be computed from measurement of the .1T against vertical depth increment. Unconformity may be recognised by an abrupt change of moveout of adjacent primary events. Topographical features up-dip away from the well may be recognised by an increase in the LT or in the termination of an event away from the time-depth curve. Dip increasing 'up-dip' away from the well can be observed in the data; however, if dip is decreasing 'up-dip' (i.e. crest of an anticline) then the event in question will disappear from the data. This data will normally have been filtered using the 'optimum' filter designed after F-K analysis to determine the usable bandwidth of the upgoing wavefield.\",\n",
       " \"Display VC(FK) (F-K Display of Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time: before enhancement) This display shows the Upgoing Wavefield, at two-way time, transformed into F-K space. Any filter applied to the data before transformation will be detailed on the side label. General Comments on F-K displays, made under Display VA(FK) also apply to this display. Since the Upgoing Wavefield is aligned horizontally, or near-horizontally, in T-X space (unless there is steep dip across the Well location) it is aligned vertically, through zero wave number, in F-K space. This display, together with Display VE(FK) is used to establish the usable frequency bandwidth of the Upgoing Wavefield to aid design of the so-called 'optimum' filter applied to the data in Displays VC, VD, VE, 7F, VG1 and VH. The 'optimum' filter is the least restrictive filter that can be applied to the Upgoing Wavefield to remove noise whilst retaining good resolution of the data in the zone of interest (if the zone of interest is not known, then it is assumed to be just above T.D. of the well). For this reason, the F-K analysis is performed on data within window around the zone of interest. Additionally, the data is windowed in time so that the data close to the Time-Depth curve, where we would expect better resolution, is analysed. This analysis and the F-K analysis of the Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield indicate the limits of the frequency bandwidth in the data. Based on these guidelines, filter trials will be carried out and the 'optimum' filter chosen from the results. Displays VE and VF (Deconvolved Upgoin2 Wavefield at two-way time; These displays show the data as in Display VC after application of deterministic deconvolution using operators derived from the Downgoing Wavefield, on trace by trace basis. The effect of the deconvolution will be to remove all reverber, associated with at least one reflector above the geophone position from which the downgoing wavefield has been extracted. The deconvolution is applied in spiking mode, unless otherwise stated, and the phase of the resulting data will be function of the filter applied after deconvolution. This is normally zero phase filter giving zero phase result and maximum resolution of the lithology within the band limits. At the client's discretion any other phase filter can be utilised. The data shown on Display VF is that of VE after enhancement by application of a spatial filter as described for Display VD. These displays describe the primary reflection response of the subsurface at the borehole location within the limits of the depth range of the VSP geophone positions and additionally the primary reflection response below the deepest VSP level. When using this response, the accurate prediction of acoustic impedance variation below TD will depend on the geometry of the subsurface below the deepest VSP level. /Cont d. •\",\n",
       " \"The comments on the effect of dip etc., made under Display VC and VD also apply to this display. The dip can be simply calculated from Displays VE and VF using either of the methods described in Appendix contained with this enclosure. Most programmable calculators can be programmed to allow these calculations to be done very simply and quickly. Display VE(FK) (F-K Disnlay of Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time; before enhancement) This display shows the Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield, at two-way time, transformed into F-K space. Any filter applied to the data before transformation will be detailed on the side label. All ,seneral Comments made under Display VC(FK) also apply to this display. The same analysis window will be used in the F-K transformation of both the Upgoing and the Deconvolved Upgoing wavefields; the resulting displays [VC(FK) and VE(FK)] will mainly differ in areas of low amplitude on the VC(FK) display which will be boosted during deconvolution. Display VH (Deconvolved Downgoing Wavefield at two-way time) This display is included to indicate the wavelets that will reside in the deconvoived upgoing wavefields of Displays VE and T. It also serves to illustrate how effective the inverse operator is at collapsing the downgoing wavefield from which it has been designed. Reverberants with periods longer than the operator length used will remain in this display and will indicate some of the multiples that will be retained in displays VE and VF (Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield). In order to afford direct comparison in time with Displays VE and VF, the wavelets have been shifted to their two-way time position before display. The side-lobe activity of the wavelets is most likely to be function of the filter applied after the application of the inverse operator. This level of 'side-lobe' will also be present in Displays VE and VF. Display VI (Residual Wavefield at one-way time) In this display both the upgoing and downgoing wavefields have been removed. Most VSP data contains many other events in addition to the vertical upgoing and downgoing wavefields. Reflections from fault planes, diffraction energy from point diffractors near the borehole and mode converted shear (SV) energy are some of the possible events which will be revealed by this display. Additionally, residual tube wave energy will also be identified when present. The interpretation of these types of events are difficult except for diffraction hyperbolae and some fault plane reflections. • /cont'd...\",\n",
       " \"The method for calculation of the distance of diffraction points from the well is described in Appendix contained with this enclosure. This display is produced at SEC normal polarity only. Display VG (Interpreter's Composite) This display is designed for use in interpretation and is therefore presented at the scale(s) of the seismic section. It contains the enhanced, deconvolved upgoing wavfield, the transposed deconvolved upgoing wavefield (see explanation below) and the calibrated velocity log. If Synthetic Seismogram processing has been carried out then this display will also include the formation density log (if available), acoustic impedance log, reflection coefficient series and the Synthetic Seismogram responses 'Primaries Without Transmission loss' and 'Primaries plus short term multiples'. Note that all comments made in the description of Display VF are relevant to the enhanced, deconvoived upgoing wavefield included in this display. Two versions of this display will normally be produced (both at seismic scale(s)) VGI: Filtered using the 'optimum' filter designed after F-K analysis to determine the usable bandwidth of the upgoing wavefield. VG2: Filtered with the filter used in seismic processing. Transposed Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield The transposed display is obtained by shifting the deconvolved upgoing wavefield data so that the time-depth curve is transposed to the left or right hand edge of the display; thereby moving events that cut the time-depth curve to the edge of the display, enabling easier comparison with the seismic section. The Interpreter's Composite Display (VG) contains two displays of the transposed data; with the time-depth curve repositioned at both the right and left edges 41, to enable comparison with the seismic section in both directions away from the well. This is done by producing series of output traces (typically 24) from number of corridor scans of the deconvolved upgoing wavefield. Each output trace is composed of data from series of small windows, one for each input trace, taken along the slope of the first arrival curve. The first scan on each trace is from the first arrival curve to the time of the first arrival on the following (deeper) trace, as shown in Fig.2(a) and produces output trace as shown in Fig.2(b).\",\n",
       " \"Second and subsequent corridors will be composed of series of windows parallel to the first arrival curve; their start time being determined by the end time of the previous corridor in each case, as shown in Fig.2(c). The number of corridors will be the same as the number of output traces requested. The last window for output trace will extend to the end of the data on the deepest input trace; for output trace the last window will extend to the end of data on the next to deepest input trace and so on. This method of transposition of the deconvolved upgoing wavefield ensures that all Primary reflections appear at true times and depths along the left hand (or right hand) edge of the display in order to facilitate comparison of this data with the relevant piece of seismic section. Changes of dip, indicated by changes of aT from trace to trace on an event on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display will be retained visually in this transposed display but the amount of aT between traces will be altered slightly; any dip calculations therefore should be made from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display. The number of transposed traces displayed will be variable, dependent on dip, but will typically be 24.

The velocity of the material above the reflector can be regarded as constant.

These values can be obtained from combination of the computation sheet and deconvolved upgoing wavefield display as follows: given dipping Primary reflection observed on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield, then choose pair of geophone traces to be used in the dip calculation. We would advise that the estimate be made using data as close as possible to the time-depth curve as the due to dip is at its greatest for any given geophone spacing when the geophone is closest to the reflector in question. : the one-way first arrival time at the deeper of the chosen geophone positions can be obtained from the computation sheet (tc at relevant depth). Alternatively, if the computation sheet is not available, the equivalent two-way time can be measured from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display (time at time-depth curve on relevant trace) and halved; this method is less accurate. :2 : the one-way first arrival time at the shallower of the chosen geophone positions (tc, at relevant depth, on computation sheet) the time of the arrival of the reflection from the dipping horizon in question at the deeper of the chosen geophone positions. This can be obtained from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield by measuring the two-way time, on the deeper chosen trace, to the reflection being examined, and subtracting the one-way first arrival time at the same geophone (i.e. t1) Similarly, can be obtained from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield by measuring the two-way time to the reflection being examined, on the shallower of the chosen geophone traces, and subtracting t7. By substituting these values (ti, tl, t3 and t4) in equations 1-3 the angle of :o, a, can be calculated. Note that azimuth of dip cannot be calculated from this data. It is suggested that dip is calculated for number of geophone pairs to give an indication of the scatter on the dip estimate. If the beds are not plane dipping then shorter segments of the reflector have to be used to determine the dip at any point, with an increasing likelihood of error. Alternatively, the can be smoothed by hand to give an 'average' dip estimate.\",\n",

It should be noted that compression waves travelling near horizontally between the diffraction point and the well can only be detected by horizontally polarised geophone and, conversely, vertically polarised geophone will only detect the SV component of the horizontally travelling wave. The e7act nature of the wave motion which results from diffraction of this kind has not been studied in the subsurface. It seems most likely that there is mode conversion from nearly vertical to nearly horizontal SV. However, if this nearly horizontal travel happens to be along or close to formation boundary, other motions, such as the pseudo-Rayleigh wave may develop. For practical purposes the assumption of mode conversion from to SV seems adequate and VcVa can be used where compressional input source and vertically polarised geophone have been used.',\n",

       " \"VERTICAL SEISMIC PROFILE REPORT APPENDIX Description of V.S.P. Displays Vertical Well: Source at Well Head Display VA (Stacked Geophone Data at one-way time) This display indicates the quality of the data used in the subsequent VSP processing. The trace displayed for each geophone position is the result of editing, as appropriate, and summing common depth traces; the common depth traces having undergone trace alignment procedure (based on cross correlation) in order to obtain accurate alignment prior to summation. Source signature deconvolution will have been applied to marine data, unless otherwise stated, using the gun hydrophone signal as source signature. Wavelet stabilisation may optionally have been applied to the data to remove variations in source character due to changing source conditions, (particularly onshore) an/or variation in geophone coupling. A broad band filter will have been applied to this data in order to remove noise without compromising the usable bandwidth of the data. The polarity of this display is such that the first downgoing arrival is plotted as black peak. (SEG normal polarity) Display VA(FK) (F-K Display of Stacked Geophone Data at One-Way Time) This display shows the stacked geophone data (after source signature deconvolution, if appropriate) at one-way time transformed into F-K space. This data is displayed as wave number (K) against frequency, with variation in colour indicating amplitude in dB below the maximum amplitude. A velocity alignment in T-X space transforms to an alignment in F-K space, rotated through 90°; the various wavefields (i.e. velocity alignments) commonly observed in T-X space transform into F-K space as illustrated in Fig.1 The strongest wavefield will normally be the Downgoing wavefield and this transforms into an alignment from zero wave number, zero frequency sloping in the positive wave number direction. Significant velocity changes in wavefield will result in multiple alignments in F-K space; although in practice it may not be possible to differentiate between the different F-K alignments and the resulting event may be smeared. /Cont'd....\",\n",
       " \"The data may be split into sections before transformation, in order to allow better analysis. The likely reasons for treating the data in this way are: to separate out areas of differing velocity, differing data quality, differing geophone separation or differing bandwidth. When alignments intercept the or -4 axis they will 'wrap around'. The frequency at which the intercept occurs is the fundamental alias frequency; further aliasing will occur at harmonics of this frequency. It should be noted that the resolution of the VSP data, after wavefield separation, is not limited by the fundamental alias frequency. The effects of spatial aliasing on the data will be small and, in particular, after application of non-linear spatial filters (i.e. our normal method of enhancing the data) the aliasing effects can be assumed to be negligible. This display illustrates, in convenient form, the various prominent wavefields in the data together with the extent of their frequency bandwidths, the genera noise level and specific noise problems. In addition to general data analysis,0 it is used to establish the usable bandwidth of the Downgoing Wavefield in order to design the broad band preliminary filter applied to the data in Display VA. Display VB (Downgoing Wavefield) This display represents series of downgoing wavefields observed at successive locations (i.e. geophone positions) in the borehole. This display is produced by shifting the data as shown in Display VA so that the direct arrivals, and therefore the Downgoing Wavefield are aligned in time; spatial filter is then applied to remove random noise and crossing wavefields. The downgoing wavefield trace extracted for each geophone position describes fully the multiple systems that will occur as tail to reflector at or near that geophone position. comparison of downgoing wavefield with reflection occurring at the same depth on the seismic section at the well, will reveal any residual multiple activity on the seismic section associated with that particular reflector. For this exercise the observed polarity of the reflection on the seismic section should be matched with the same polarity first arrival on the VSP downgoing wavefield, i.e. white trough matched to white trough or black peak to black peak. In the same manner the downgoing wavefield display can be correlated with the upgoing wavefield of Displays VC and VD to establish the presence and origin of multiples within the VSP data. Note that this display is provided in two forms: (a) VB1 : filtered with the broad band preliminary filter only. This display essentially shows the data from which the deconvolution operators have been derived. (b) VB2 : filtered so that the bandwidth matches that of the seismic data, in the zone of interest, to enable identification of residual multiples in the seismic data. This version is presented at the scale(s) of the seismic section. These displays are produced at both polarities. /Cont'd...\",\n",
       " \"Displays VC and VD (Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time; before and after enhancement) These displays show the Primary and Multiple activity observed at the borehole location from the shallowest VSP geophone position to some way below the deepest VSP geophone position (and therefore, normally, some way below Total Depth of the borehole). The data shown on Display VD is that of Display VC after application of spatial filter; this spatial filter will be the result of various trials and will have been chosen to give the best enhancement of the upgoing events (horizontal and/or dipping) observed in the data. In marine data, if source signature deconvolution has been applied, then the input wavelet will be zero-phase and the wavelet contained in the data will be zero phase modified by earth absorption and transmission loss effects (i.e. mixed phase). In the case of onshore data, if neither wavelet stablisation nor source signature deconvolution has been applied, then the source signature remains in the data. Wavelet stabilisation can be carried out by shaping to any given wavelet; we would recommend, however, that all geophone data is transformed to the waveform of shallow geophone level. In this case then the source signature effectively remains in the data but is made consistent from level to level. Events that reach the time-depth curve are primary and their lithologic significance can be established unequivocally by reference to the calibrated velocity log. This comparison can be made using Display VG1 which contains the data from Display VF and the calibrated velocity log at the scale(s) of the seismic section. Multiples having their last bounce from primary within the ran2e of the VSP may be identified by observing their termination in the data at the same depth point at which the primary cuts the time-depth curve. From this display, any dip across the well location can be recognised by move- out of the primary event to shorter time, as the geophone moves up the well and away from the lithology creating the reflection. No azimuth of dip can be computed from this display but true-dip can be computed from measurement of the .1T against vertical depth increment. Unconformity may be recognised by an abrupt change of moveout of adjacent primary events. Topographical features up-dip away from the well may be recognised by an increase in the LT or in the termination of an event away from the time-depth curve. Dip increasing 'up-dip' away from the well can be observed in the data; however, if dip is decreasing 'up-dip' (i.e. crest of an anticline) then the event in question will disappear from the data. This data will normally have been filtered using the 'optimum' filter designed after F-K analysis to determine the usable bandwidth of the upgoing wavefield.\",\n",
       " \"Display VC(FK) (F-K Display of Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time: before enhancement) This display shows the Upgoing Wavefield, at two-way time, transformed into F-K space. Any filter applied to the data before transformation will be detailed on the side label. General Comments on F-K displays, made under Display VA(FK) also apply to this display. Since the Upgoing Wavefield is aligned horizontally, or near-horizontally, in T-X space (unless there is steep dip across the Well location) it is aligned vertically, through zero wave number, in F-K space. This display, together with Display VE(FK) is used to establish the usable frequency bandwidth of the Upgoing Wavefield to aid design of the so-called 'optimum' filter applied to the data in Displays VC, VD, VE, VF, VG1 and VH. The 'optimum' filter is the least restrictive filter that can be applied to the Upgoing Wavefield to remove noise whilst retaining good resolution of the data in the zone of interest (if the zone of interest is not known, then it is assumed to be just above T.D. of the well). For this reason, the F-K analysis is performed on data within window around the zone of interest. Additionally, the data is windowed in time so that the data close to the Time-Depth curve, where we would expect better resolution, is analysed. This analysis and the F-K analysis of the Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield indicate the limits of the frequency bandwidth in the data. Based on these guidelines, filter trials will be carried out and the 'optimum' filter chosen from the results. Displays VE and VF (Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time; These displays show the data as in Display VC after application of deterministic deconvolution using operators derived from the Downgoing Wavefield, on trace by trace basis. The effect of the deconvolution will be to remove all reverbelills associated with at least one reflector above the geophone position from which the downgoing wavefield has been extracted. The deconvolution is applied in spiking mode, unless otherwise stated, and the phase of the resulting data will be function of the filter applied after deconvolution. This is normally zero phase filter giving zero phase result and maximum resolution of the lithology within the band limits. At the client's discretion any other phase filter can be utilised. The data shown on Display VF is that of VE after enhancement by application of a spatial filter as described for Display VD. These displays describe the primary reflection response of the subsurface at the borehole location within the limits of the depth range of the VSP geophone positions and additionally the primary reflection response below the deepest VSP level. When using this response, the accurate prediction of acoustic impedance variation below TD will depend on the geometry of the subsurface below the deepest VSP level.\",\n",
       " \"• The comments on the effect of dip etc., made under Display VC and VD also apply to this display. The dip can be simply calculated from Displays VE and VF using either of the methods described in Appendix contained with this enclosure. Most programmable calculators can be programmed to allow these calculations to be done very simply and quickly. Display VE(FK) (F-K Display of Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time; before enhancement) This display shows the Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield, at two-way time, transformed into F-K space. Any filter applied to the data before transformation will be detailed on the side label. All general Comments made under Display VC(FK) also apply to this display. The same analysis window will be used in the F-K transformation of both the Upgoing and the Deconvolved Upgoing wavefields; the resulting displays (VC(FK) and VE(FK)] will mainly differ in areas of low amplitude on the VC(FK) display which will be boosted during deconvolution. Display VH (Deconvolved Downgoing Wavefield at two-way time) This display is included to indicate the wavelets that will reside in the deconvolved upgoing wavefields of Displays VE and VF. It also serves to illustrate how effective the inverse operator is at collapsing the downgoing wavefield from which it has been designed. Reverberants with periods longer than the operator length used will remain in this display and will indicate some of the multiples that will be retained in displays VE and VF (Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield). In order to afford direct comparison in time with Displays VE and VF, the wavelets have been shifted to their two-way time position before display. The side-lobe activity of the wavelets is most likely to be function of the filter applied after the application of the inverse operator. This level of 'side-lobe' will also be present in Displays VE and VF. Display VI (Residual Wavefield at one-way time) In this display both the upgoing and downgoing wavefields have been removed. Most VSP data contains many other events in addition to the vertical upgoing and downgoing wavefields. Reflections from fault planes, diffraction energy from point diffractors near the borehole and mode converted shear (SV) energy are some of the possible events which will be revealed by this display. Additionally, residual tube wave energy will also be identified when present. The interpretation of these types of events are difficult except for diffraction hyperbolae and some fault plane reflections. /cont'd...\",\n",
       " \"The method for calculation of the distance of diffraction points from the well. is described in Appendix contained with this enclosure. This display is produced at SEC normal polarity only. Display VG (Interpreter's Composite) This display is designed for use in interpretation and is therefore presented at the scale(s) of the seismic section. It contains the enhanced, deconvolved upgoing wavfield, the transposed deconvolved upgoing wavefield (see explanation below) and the calibrated velocity log. If Synthetic Seismogram processing has been carried out then this display will also include the formation density log (if available), acoustic impedance log, reflection coefficient series and the Synthetic Seismogram responses 'Primaries Without Transmission loss' and 'Primaries plus short term multiples'. Note that all comments made in the description of Display VF are relevant to the enhanced, deconvolved upgoing wavefield included in this display. Two versions of this display will normally be produced (both at seismic scale(s),. VG1: Filtered using the 'optimum' filter designed after F-K analysis to determine the usable bandwidth of the upgoing wavefield. VG2: Filtered with the filter used in seismic processing. Transposed Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield The transposed display is obtained by shifting the deconvolved upgoing wavefield data so that the time-depth curve is transposed to the left or right hand edge of the display; thereby moving events that cut the time-depth curve to the edge of the display, enabling easier comparison with the seismic section. The Interpreter's Composite Display (VG) contains tRogodisplays of the transposillo data; with the time-depth curve repositioned at both the right and left edges to enable comparison with the seismic section in both directions away from the well. This is done by producing series of output traces (typically 24) from number of corridor scans of the deconvolved upgoing wavefield. Each output trace is composed of data from series of small windows, one for each input trace, taken along the slope of the first arrival curve. The first scan on each trace is from the first arrival curve to the time of the first arrival on the following (deeper) trace, as shown in Fig.2(a) and produces output trace as shown in Fig.2(b). /Cont'd..Alk\",\n",
       " \"Second and subsequent corridors will be composed of series of windows parallel to the first arrival curve; their start time being determined by the end time of the previous corridor in each case, as shown in Fig.2(c). The number of corridors will be the same as the number of output traces requested. The last window for output trace will extend to the end of the data on the deepest input trace; for output trace the last window will extend to the end of data on the next to deepest input trace and so on. This method of transposition of the deconvolved upgoing wavefield ensures that all Primary reflections appear at true times and depths along the left hand (or right hand) edge of the display in order to facilitate comparison of this data with the relevant piece of seismic section. Changes of dip, indicated by changes of AT from trace to trace on an event on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display will be retained visually in this transposed display but the amount of AT between traces will be altered slightly; any dip calculations therefore should be made from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display. The number of transposed traces displayed will be variable, dependent on dip, but will typically be 24.

       " \"kPPENDIX 2/3 Method of Calculation To calculate the' dip of any Primary reflection observed on VSP data we therefore require tl, t2, t3 and t4. These values can be obtained from combination of the computation sheet and deconvolved upgoing wavefield display as follows: C;iven dipping Primary reflection observed on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield, then choose pair of geophone traces to be used in the dip calculation. We would advise that the estimate be made using data as close as possible to the time-depth curve as the due to dip is at its greatest for any given geophone spacing when the geophone is closest to the reflector in question. the one-way first arrival time at the deeper of the chosen geophone positions can be obtained from the computation sheet (tc at relevant depth). Alternatively, if the computation sheet is not available, the equivalent two-way time can be measured from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display (time at time-depth curve on relevant trace) and halved; this method is less accurate. tl : tile one-way first arrival time at the snallower of the chosen geophone positions (tc, at relevant depth, on computation sheet) the time of the arrival of the reflection from the dipping horizon in question at the deeper of the chosen geophone positions. This can be obtained from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield by measuring the two-way time, on the deeper chosen trace, to the reflection being examined, and subtracting the one-way first arrival time at the same geophone (i.e. ti) Similarly, t4 : can be obtained from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield by measuring the two-way time to the reflection being examined, on the shallower of the chosen geophone traces, and subtracting t2. By substituting these values (ti, t2, t3 and t4) in equations 1-3 the angle of dip,a, can be calculated. Note that azimuth of dip cannot be calculated from this data. It is suggested that dip is calculated for number of geophone pairs to give an indication of the scatter on the dip estimate. :f the beds are not plane dipping then shorter segments of the reflector have to be used to determine the dip at any point, with an increasing likelihood of error. Alternatively, the can be smoothed by hand to give an 'average' dip estimate. •\",\n",
       " \"APPENDIX 2/4 Changes of dip, as characterised by changes in AT from trace to trace on an event on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield, can be assessed if dip is increasing 'up-dip'; however, if dip is decreasing 'up-dip' then the event in question will disappear from the data. Quick Estimate If dipping reflection event observed on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display can be followed across from the first arrival curve to trace recorded at or near the surface quick estimate of dip can be made.

It should be noted that compression waves travelling near horizontally between the diffraction point and the well can only be detected by horizontally polarised geophone and, conversely, vertically polarised geophone will only detect the SV component of the horizontally travelling wave. The exact nature of the wave motion which results from diffraction of this kind has not been studied in the subsurface. It seems most likely that there is mode conversion from nearly vertical to nearly horizontal SV. However, if this nearly horizontal travel happens to be along or close to formation boundary, other motions, such as the pseudo-Rayleigh wave may develop. For practical purposes the assumption of mode conversion from to SV seems adequate and ViVs can be used where compressional input source and vertically polarised geophone have been used.',\n",
